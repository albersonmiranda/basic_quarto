	title = {Forecast reconciliation: A review},
	abstract = {Collections of time series that are formed via aggregation are prevalent in many fields. These are commonly referred to as hierarchical time series and may be constructed cross-sectionally across different variables, temporally by aggregating a single series at different frequencies, or may even be generalised beyond aggregation as time series that respect linear constraints. When forecasting such time series, a desirable condition is for forecasts to be coherent, that is to respect the constraints. The past decades have seen substantial growth in this field with the development of reconciliation methods that not only ensure coherent forecasts but can also improve forecast accuracy. This paper serves as both an encyclopaedic review of forecast reconciliation and an entry point for researchers and practitioners dealing with hierarchical time series. The scope of the article includes perspectives on forecast reconciliation from machine learning, Bayesian statistics and probabilistic forecasting as well as applications in economics, energy, tourism, retail demand and demography.},

	url = {https://bridges.monash.edu/articles/thesis/Optimal_forecasts_for_hierarchical_and_grouped_time_series/5032136/1},
	abstract = {Large collections of time series often have aggregation constraints due to product or geographical groupings. When the time series disaggregation is unique we refer to it as a hierarchical structure whereas when it involves different paths of disaggregation we refer to it as a grouped structure. In both of these structures, forecasts for the most disaggregated series are usually required to add-up exactly to the forecasts of the aggregated series, a constraint known as aggregation consistency. Common approaches to obtaining a set of aggregate-consistent forecasts include the "bottom-up'', "top-down'' and "middle-out'' approaches. The bottom-up approach forecasts all series at the most disaggregated level and sums the forecasts to form the forecasts for higher levels. In contrast, the top-down approach forecasts the most aggregated series and distributes these forecasts based on some proportions to form the forecasts for the disaggregated series. The middle-out approach is a combination of both bottom-up and top-down approaches. Considering the drawbacks of these approaches, Hyndman, Ahmed, Athanasopoulos, and Shang (2011) proposed forecasting all disaggregated and aggregated series independently, and then reconciling the forecasts so they become aggregate consistent. Their approach is based on a generalized least squares estimator which required an estimate of the covariance matrix of the reconciliation errors that arise due to aggregate inconsistency. In this thesis I show that this covariance matrix is impossible to estimate in practice due to identifiability conditions. To overcome this issue, I propose a new forecast reconciliation approach that minimizes the mean squared error of aggregate-consistent forecasts across the entire collection of time series under the assumption of unbiasedness. The minimization problem has a closed form solution similar to that of Hyndman et al. (2011), except that the required covariance matrix is estimable leading to a feasible solution. I make this solution scalable by providing a computationally less demanding alternative representation. I refer to this approach as {MinT}. I evaluate the performance of {MinT} compared to alternative approaches in the literature using a series of simulation designs that take into account various features of the collection of time series. This is followed by an empirical application using Australian domestic tourism data. The results indicate that {MinT} performs well with both simulated and real data. Many of the applications encountered in practice have fewer observations per series than the number of series in the structure. In such situations, the sample variance covariance matrix is known to perform poorly which makes the estimation of the covariance matrix challenging and requires the use of special strategies. I mainly focused on estimators that belong to the Stein-type shrinkage, sparse, and low rank + sparse classes. For applications with a hierarchical structure, it is reasonable to assume that the covariance matrix is a representation of some lower dimension; for example, a block diagonal structure where the series with the same parental node tend to behave more similarly than the series that are less closely related. Hence, I consider modifications for some of these estimators to incorporate prior knowledge about important relationships resulting from the aggregation constraints. In addition, I explore several possibilities of reducing the computational burden of low rank + sparse type of estimators. I evaluate the performances of these competing estimators using a series of simulation designs and several empirical applications using Australian domestic tourism data. The results indicate that most of the covariance estimators contribute to substantially improving the forecast accuracy of {MinT}. In addition, I observe that prior knowledge of the correlation structure does not play a key role in improving the forecast accuracy. One of the estimators that belongs to low rank + sparse category tends to behave unexpectedly in both simulation and empirical evaluations. Through a case study I identify the causes and propose remedies for obtaining an estimator that produces consistently better performance. {MinT} and its variants can result in negative values for the reconciled forecasts even when the original set of forecasts are non-negative. This should be avoided in certain applications that are inherently non-negative in nature, especially when the forecasts are used for decisions or policy implementation processes. Hence, {MinT} is reformulated as a least squares minimization problem with non-negativity constraints. Considering the dimension and sparsity of the matrices involved and the alternative representation of {MinT}, this problem is solved using three algorithms: block principal pivoting, projected conjugate gradient and scaled gradient projection. I compare the performances of these algorithms using a series of simulations and an empirical application. The results reveal that the block principal pivoting algorithm outperforms the rest where a structure with nearly six hundred thousand series can be reconciled in less than one minute using a standard desktop computer. In addition, it is observed that the gains or losses in forecast accuracy due to non-negativity constraints are negligible},

The purpose of the research was to reduce the overall forecasting burden by developing and assessing schemes of disaggregating forecasts of a total product line to the related individual items. Measures were developed to determine appropriate disaggregated methodologies and to compare the forecast accuracy of individual product forecasts versus disaggregated totals. Several of the procedures used were based upon extensions of the combination of forecast research and applied to disaggregations of total forecasts of product lines. The objective was to identify situations when it was advantageous to produce disaggregated forecasts, and if advantageous, which method of disaggregation to utilize. This involved identification of the general conceptual characteristics within a set of product line data that might cause a disaggregation method to produce relatively accurate forecasts. These conceptual characteristics provided guidelines for forecasters on how to select a disaggregation method and under what conditions a particular method is applicable.},

	abstract = {Forecasting a large set of time series with hierarchical aggregation constraints is a central problem for many organizations. However, it is particularly challenging to forecast these hierarchical structures. In fact, it requires not only good forecast accuracy at each level of the hierarchy, but also the coherency between different levels, i.e. the forecasts should satisfy the hierarchical aggregation constraints. Given some incoherent base forecasts, the state-of-the-art methods compute revised forecasts based on forecast combination which ensures that the aggregation constraints are satisfied. However, these methods assume the base forecasts are unbiased and constrain the revised forecasts to be also unbiased. We propose a new forecasting method which relaxes these unbiasedness conditions, and seeks the revised forecasts with the best tradeoff between bias and forecast variance. We also present a regularization method which allows us to deal with high-dimensional hierarchies, and provide its theoretical justification. Finally, we compare the proposed method with the state-of-the-art methods both theoretically and empirically. The results on both simulated and real-world data indicate that our methods provide competitive results compared to the state-of-the-art methods.},

In particular, a general framework is established that nests many existing popular reconciliation methods within the class of projections. This interpretation facilitates the derivation of novel theoretical results. First, reconciliation via projection is guaranteed to improve forecast accuracy with respect to a class of loss functions based on a generalised distance metric. Second, the Minimum Trace ({MinT}) method minimises expected loss for this same class of loss functions. Third, the geometric interpretation provides a new proof that forecast reconciliation using projections results in unbiased forecasts, provided that the initial base forecasts are also unbiased. Approaches for dealing with biased base forecasts are proposed. An extensive empirical study of Australian tourism flows demonstrates the theoretical results of the paper and shows that bias correction prior to reconciliation outperforms alternatives that only bias-correct or only reconcile forecasts.},

Such combinations offer coherent reconciled forecasts, improved forecasting performance and aligned decision-making. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical forecasting approach based on machine learning. The proposed method allows for non-linear combinations of the base forecasts, thus being more general than linear approaches. We structurally combine the objectives of improved post-sample empirical forecasting accuracy and coherence. Due to its non-linear nature, our approach selectively combines the base forecasts in a direct and automated way without requiring that the complete information must be used for producing reconciled forecasts for each series and level. The proposed method is evaluated both in terms of accuracy and bias using two different data sets coming from the tourism and retail industries. Our results suggest that the proposed method gives superior point forecasts than existing approaches, especially when the series comprising the hierarchy are not characterized by the same patterns.},

In this paper we propose a new approach to hierarchical forecasting which provides optimal forecasts that are better than forecasts produced by either a top-down or a bottom-up approach. Our method is based on independently forecasting all series at all levels of the hierarchy and then using a regression model to optimally combine and reconcile these forecasts. The resulting revised forecasts add up appropriately across the hierarchy, are unbiased and have minimum variance amongst all combination forecasts under some simple assumptions. We show in a simulation study that our method performs well compared to the top-down approach and the bottom-up method.

	abstract = {Point forecast reconciliation of collection of time series with linear aggregation constraints has evolved substantially over the last decade. A few commonly used methods are {GLS} (generalized least squares), {OLS} (ordinary least squares), {WLS} (weighted least squares), and {MinT} (minimum trace). {GLS} and {MinT} have similar mathematical expressions, but they differ by the covariance matrix used. {OLS} and {WLS} can be considered as special cases of {MinT} where they differ by the assumptions made about the structure of the covariance matrix. All these methods ensure that the reconciled forecasts are unbiased, provided that the base forecasts are unbiased. The {ERM} (empirical risk minimizer) approach was proposed to relax the assumption of unbiasedness. This paper proves that (a) {GLS} and {MinT} reduce to the same solution; (b) on average, a method similar to {ERM} (which we refer to as {MinT}-U) can produce better forecasts than {MinT} (lowest total mean squared error) which is then followed by {OLS} and then by base; and (c) the mean squared error of each series in the structure for {MinT}-U is smaller than that for {MinT} which is then followed by that for either {OLS} or base forecasts. We show these theoretical results using a set of simulation studies. We also evaluate them using the Australian domestic tourism data set.},
